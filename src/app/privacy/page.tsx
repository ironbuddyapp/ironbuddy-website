            and fitness apps, including clear disclosure of on-device data, automatic backups, and

              Workout and fitness data you enter is stored on your device. IronBuddy does not send
              it to any IronBuddy server.
            </li>
            <li>
              No IronBuddy account is required and we do not operate a cloud sync backend for your
              workouts.

            <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
            <li>The App does not include ads or third-party analytics SDKs.</li>
            <li>
              IronBuddy is free to download. It includes a free trial, and after the trial a one-time
              in-app purchase is required to keep using the app. The purchase is handled entirely by
              Google Play (see section 4).
            </li>
            <li>
              Copies of your data can exist outside the App’s private storage in three ways, all
              explained in section 7: an automatic backup file in Download/IronBuddy on your device;
              Android’s own backup to your Google account, if Google backup is turned on; and files
              you choose to export or share.

        <ContentSection id="applies-to" title="2. Who this policy applies to">
          <p>
            This policy applies to users of the IronBuddy Android application distributed on Google
            Play (and related testing tracks). It covers data processed by the App on your device.
            It does not cover Google Play, Android’s backup service, or third-party apps or
            services you later send files to (for example email, Google Drive, or messaging apps).
          </p>
        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection id="data-on-device" title="3. Data stored on your device">
          <p>
            The App stores information you provide or generate while using it in on-device storage
            (application storage / local storage). Depending on how you use IronBuddy, this may
            include:
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>Fitness / workout information:</Strong> training splits and schedules,
              exercises, sets, reps, weights, workout history, notes, and progress-related
              calculations (for example estimated strength metrics derived from your logged lifts).
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Health and fitness data:</Strong> body weight and body fat percentage entries
              (optional), and workout/training logs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Personal info you enter:</Strong> an optional display name and unit
              preferences (kg/lb).
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>App settings:</Strong> preferences such as theme, units, and whether the
              automatic backup file is turned on.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Purchase and trial status:</Strong> the date your free trial started and
              whether you have unlocked the full app, including a purchase verification token
              provided by Google Play Billing that allows the App to verify and restore your
              entitlement to the one-time purchase. This is stored on your device. The App does not
              receive or store your payment details.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            This information is used only to provide App features (planning workouts, logging
            sessions, showing progress charts, backups you can restore from, and unlocking the full
            app). We do not receive this data on IronBuddy servers because the App does not upload
            your training data to an IronBuddy cloud service.
          </p>
        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection id="purchases" title="4. Purchases and payment processing">
          <p>
            IronBuddy is free to download and use for a free trial period (currently 5 days). After
            the trial, a one-time in-app purchase is required to keep using the app; there are no
            subscriptions. The purchase is made and processed entirely by Google Play
            using Google Play Billing. The App receives from Google Play only confirmation that the
            purchase exists (the product identifier and a purchase token) and stores it on your
            device so it can unlock features and check your purchase again when you open the App or
            reinstall it. The App does not receive, access, or store your payment card, billing
            address, or other payment details. The trial start date is kept on your device.
          </p>
          <p>

        <ContentSection id="review-prompts" title="5. In-app review prompts">
          <p>
            IronBuddy may occasionally prompt you to rate the app using Google Play&apos;s built-in
            review feature. This prompt is displayed and processed entirely by Google Play —
            IronBuddy does not receive, access, or store any information about whether you viewed,
            completed, or dismissed a review prompt, nor the content of any review you submit. For
            details on how Google Play handles this, see <GooglePolicyLink />.

          <BulletList>
            <li>Create user accounts or require sign-in</li>
            <li>Collect data onto IronBuddy-operated servers</li>

        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection id="backups" title="7. Backups, exports, and sharing">
          <p>Copies of your data can exist in these ways:</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>Automatic backup file (on your device):</Strong> each time your data changes,
              the App saves one up-to-date JSON copy of it at
              Download/IronBuddy/ironbuddy-backup.json, replacing the previous copy — the App does
              not keep numbered copies. The file stays on your device; it can be read by you and by
              other apps you allow to access your files. You can turn this off in Settings → Backup
              &amp; Data. After reinstalling the App, Android may ask you to choose the IronBuddy
              folder once so the App can replace the file left by the earlier installation; the App
              uses only the folder you choose.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Android Auto Backup (Google account):</Strong> IronBuddy allows Android’s
              built-in Auto Backup feature. If backup is enabled on your Android device, the Android
              operating system may create an encrypted backup of certain App data and store it in
              your Google account. This backup is managed entirely by Google and Android. IronBuddy
              does not receive, access, view, process, or control these backups. Android may use the
              backup to restore your data when reinstalling the App or setting up a new device. You
              can disable Android backups or remove existing backups through your device’s Google
              Backup settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Export a copy / Share:</Strong> the system share sheet for a JSON copy of your
              data or a PDF of your active split; you choose where it goes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Import / restore:</Strong> you may choose a backup file to load into the App.
              The App keeps one copy of your data from just before an import inside the App so you
              can undo it.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Exports, sharing, and imports are started by you. Once a file is saved or shared, the
            destination (Downloads folder, email, Drive, messaging apps, etc.) is outside
            IronBuddy’s control and subject to that destination’s policies. Uninstalling the App
            does not automatically delete files already saved in Downloads or a backup stored in
            your Google account.
          </p>
        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection id="transmission" title="8. Data handling and transmission">
          <p>
            IronBuddy does not transmit workout logs, body measurements, exercise history, notes, or
            other fitness information to IronBuddy-operated servers. All such information remains on
            your device unless you explicitly export, share, or back up your data using Android’s
            backup services or another destination you choose.
          </p>
        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection id="permissions" title="9. Permissions">
          <p>The App may request or declare permissions such as:</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>Internet / network:</Strong> used by the Android WebView/OS networking stack
              (for example, if you open external links such as open-source credits). The App does
              not use this to upload your workout, body, or personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Google Play Billing:</Strong> lets the App ask Google Play about, and
              complete, the one-time in-app purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Storage / media access (as required by Android version):</Strong> to save the
              automatic backup file and exports in Downloads, and to read files you choose to
              import. If you choose a folder with Android’s folder picker, the App can access only
              that folder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Android Auto Backup:</Strong> No additional permission is requested from the
              user for Android’s Auto Backup feature. When enabled in device settings, the feature
              is provided by the Android operating system.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Exact permission labels shown by Android may vary by OS version. Unused sensitive
            permissions are not requested for core logging features.

            </li>

              <Strong>Backup files:</Strong> the automatic backup file and any JSON or PDF files you
              saved under Downloads (or shared elsewhere) are not removed by uninstalling or by
              Reset All Data; delete them manually if you no longer want those copies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Google backup:</Strong> a backup stored in your Google account can be deleted
              in your phone’s settings (Google → Backup) or from your Google account.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
