        <ContentSection id="what-it-is" title="What a Push Pull Legs split is">
          <p>
            A split decides which muscles you train on which day. Push Pull Legs divides the body by
            the direction of the movement. Pressing exercises share the chest, front shoulders and
            triceps, so they go together. Pulling exercises share the back, rear shoulders and
            biceps. Legs get a day of their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because each day works muscles that help each other, one day&apos;s training does not
            tire out the next day&apos;s. That makes PPL easy to repeat week after week.

            Put the heaviest compound lift first, while you are fresh, and the smaller isolation
            exercises after it. Swap any lift for a variation that suits your equipment or joints: a
            dumbbell press for a barbell press, or a leg press for a squat.
