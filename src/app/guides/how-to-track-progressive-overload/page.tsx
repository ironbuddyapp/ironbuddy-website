            <li>
              Progressive overload is doing slightly more over time: more weight, more reps, more
              sets, or better-quality reps.
            </li>
            <li>You cannot see overload without a log. Record weight, reps, and sets every time.</li>
            <li>
              Change one thing at a time. Double progression, adding reps first and then weight, is
              an easy default.
            </li>
            <li>Review weekly, and look at total volume and your best sets, not a single day.</li>

        <ContentSection id="what-it-means" title="What progressive overload means">
          <p>
            Progressive overload is the principle of gradually increasing the demand you place on
            your muscles so they keep adapting. In the gym that usually means lifting a little more
            weight, doing a few more reps, adding a set, or performing the same reps with better
            control and range of motion than before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key word is gradually. Small, repeatable increases add up, while big jumps tend to
            break form or stall.

          <p>
            Double progression uses a rep range instead of a single target. Choose a range such as
            8 to 12 reps and start at a weight where you can reach the bottom of it. Each session,
            try to add a rep. When you reach the top of the range on every set, add the smallest
            weight increment and start again near the bottom.

            In session 4 every set reaches the top of the range, so session 5 adds the smallest
            weight increment and starts near the bottom of the range again. This is an illustration,
            not a prescription: progress is usually slower than this, and smaller weight jumps are
            fine.

        <ContentSection id="volume-and-1rm" title="Reading volume and 1RM">
          <p>
            <Strong>Training volume</Strong> is commonly calculated as sets × reps × weight. Three
            sets of 8 reps at 60 kg is 1,440 kg of volume. If volume for an exercise rises over
            several weeks while your form holds up, you are doing more work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <Strong>1RM</Strong> (one-rep max), calculated with the Epley formula, predicts the heaviest single rep you could lift, based on
            a heavier set of several reps. One widely used formula, Epley, multiplies the weight by
            (1 + reps ÷ 30), so 60 kg for 8 reps comes out at about 76 kg. IronBuddy uses Epley.
            Other apps may use other formulas, and estimates get less reliable at high reps, so
            treat the number as a trend line, not a promise.

            Progress is not a straight line. If a lift has not improved for three or four weeks,
            check the basics first: sleep, food, stress, and whether your form and range of motion
            have stayed consistent. Then consider a lighter week, a small change to the rep range,
            or a different variation of the lift.
