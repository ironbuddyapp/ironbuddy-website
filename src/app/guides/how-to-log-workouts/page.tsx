          <p>
            Log each set right after you finish it, while the numbers are fresh. Logging later from
            memory is where mistakes creep in. If you prefer to log at the end of a session, jot the
            weights and reps down as you go and enter them straight after. If you miss a session,
            log it for the day it happened as soon as you can.
          </p>

        <ContentSection id="naming" title="Keep exercise names consistent">
          <p>
            The same lift under two names splits your history in two, so you cannot see a trend.
            Choose one name per exercise and stick with it. A library that lists variations by
            equipment, such as barbell, dumbbell, or machine, makes it easier to pick the exact one
            you did.
          </p>

        <ContentSection id="plan-first" title="Plan first, then log">
          <p>
            A training split tells you which exercises to expect on each day, so logging becomes
            filling in numbers instead of deciding what to do. Templates such as Push/Pull/Legs,
            Upper/Lower, and Full Body are a starting point you can edit. See{" "}

        <ContentSection id="review-and-backup" title="Review and back up your log">
          <p>
            A log only helps if you look at it. Once a week, compare your best sets and total volume
            with recent weeks; the{" "}
            <TextLink href={pages.progressiveOverload.path}>progressive overload guide</TextLink>{" "}
            shows a simple routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            A log is also only useful if it survives a lost phone. Keep a backup. IronBuddy can save
            an automatic JSON backup file in your Downloads folder, and you can export a copy
            yourself whenever you like.
