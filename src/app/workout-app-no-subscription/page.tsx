          <p>
            No monthly or yearly plan, no renewal date, and no payment that needs cancelling.
            IronBuddy&apos;s privacy policy states plainly that there are no subscriptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A training log is something you keep for years, so it helps when opening your history
            never depends on an active plan.

        <ContentSection id="no-ads" title="What “no ads” means">
          <p>
            IronBuddy shows no ads. Its privacy policy also says the app does not include
            advertising SDKs or third-party analytics SDKs, so nothing competes for your attention
            between sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad networks typically rely on device identifiers and usage data to target ads. An app
            with no advertising SDKs has no need to share your data that way. See{" "}

            These checks take a few minutes and work for any app, including IronBuddy. Do them
