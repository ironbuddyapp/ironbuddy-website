        <ContentSection id="offline-first" title="Offline-first versus “offline mode”">
          <p>
            Some apps offer an offline mode that still depends on an account and a server: you log
            workouts on your phone and they sync when you are back online. Offline-first is
            different. The copy on your phone is the real one, and nothing has to sync for it to be
            complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            IronBuddy has no IronBuddy account and does not operate a cloud sync backend for your
            workouts, so there is nothing to sign in to and nothing waiting to upload. The trade-off
            is that you are responsible for backups, covered below.

          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>Reception:</Strong> basements, garages, and concrete-walled gyms often have
              weak signal or no Wi-Fi.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Travel:</Strong> hotel gyms and gyms abroad, where you may not want to use

            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Speed:</Strong> logging does not depend on a network request, so saving a set
              is never held up by a slow connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Ownership:</Strong> your history is not tied to an account that could be
              closed or a service that could change its terms.

          <p>
            Because your workouts are stored on your device, backups matter. IronBuddy gives you
            three layers:
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>An automatic backup file:</Strong> each time your data changes, IronBuddy saves
              an up-to-date JSON copy in your Downloads folder
              (Download/IronBuddy/ironbuddy-backup.json). You can turn this off in Settings, under
              Backup &amp; Data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Android Auto Backup:</Strong> if Google backup is turned on for your phone,
              Android may back up certain app data to your Google account. Google and Android manage
              this, not IronBuddy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Manual export:</Strong> share a JSON copy of your data, or a PDF of your active
              split, wherever you choose. To move to a new phone you own, import a backup file there.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Uninstalling the app removes its private storage, but not files already saved in
            Downloads or a backup in your Google account. Read the full{" "}
