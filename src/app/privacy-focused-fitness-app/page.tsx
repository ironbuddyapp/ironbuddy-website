          <p>
            According to the IronBuddy privacy policy, the app keeps the following in on-device
            storage:
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>Workout information:</Strong> training splits and schedules, exercises, sets,
              reps, weights, history, notes, and progress calculations such as estimated strength
              metrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Body metrics:</Strong> optional body weight and body fat percentage entries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Personal info you enter:</Strong> an optional display name and kg or lb unit
              preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>App settings:</Strong> preferences such as theme, units, and whether the
              automatic backup file is on.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Purchase and trial status:</Strong> when your free trial started and whether
              you unlocked the full app, using a purchase token from Google Play Billing. IronBuddy
              does not receive or store your payment details.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            None of this is uploaded to an IronBuddy server. The policy says IronBuddy does not
            transmit workout logs, body measurements, exercise history, notes, or other fitness
            information to IronBuddy-operated servers (
            <TextLink href={policy("transmission")}>section 8</TextLink>).

          <p>As of the policy&apos;s last updated date, IronBuddy does not:</p>
          <BulletList>

            <li>Collect data onto IronBuddy-operated servers</li>
            <li>Use advertising SDKs or sell personal data</li>

        <ContentSection id="copies" title="Where copies of your data can exist">
          <p>
            Your data lives on your device, but copies can exist in three ways, all under your
            control or Android&apos;s:
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              <Strong>An automatic backup file</Strong> in your Downloads folder, updated whenever
              your data changes. You can turn it off in Settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Android Auto Backup</Strong> to your Google account, if Google backup is on
              for your phone. Google and Android manage it; IronBuddy does not receive or access
              these backups.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Files you export or share,</Strong> such as a JSON copy of your data or a PDF
              of your active split. You choose where they go.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Once a file is saved or shared, the destination is outside IronBuddy&apos;s control.
            Uninstalling the app does not delete files already saved in Downloads or a backup in
            your Google account. See{" "}
            <TextLink href={policy("backups")}>section 7 of the policy</TextLink>.

              <Strong>Internet / network,</Strong> used by Android&apos;s networking stack, for
              example when you open an external link. Not used to upload your workout, body, or
              personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Google Play Billing,</Strong> to complete the in-app purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Storage / media access,</Strong> to save the backup file and exports in
              Downloads and to read files you choose to import. If you pick a folder with
              Android&apos;s folder picker, the app can access only that folder.
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Exact permission labels vary by Android version. See{" "}

          <p>
            Because IronBuddy does not host your workout data on its servers, there is no separate
            cloud account to ask us to delete.
